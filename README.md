# CS144

Personal archive of solutions to tasks of CS144 at Stanford University for Spring 2024.

Stanford CS144 offers a comprehensive introduction to computer networking, providing students with a strong understanding of the principles, protocols, and technologies that underpin modern computer networks. There are two versions of labs, sponge and minnow. I choose to implement the sponge version.

## Lab

I implemented the sponge version [here](https://github.com/coleanthony/sponge).
